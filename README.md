A) App.js
   1. The `<li>` element contains a button with an `onClick` event handler that triggers the `showUsers()` function when clicked. This suggests that clicking the button will fetch and display user data.

   2. The `showUsers()` function is defined and performs the following actions:
      It defines a constant variable `source` with the URL of an API endpoint.
      It uses the `fetch()` function to send a GET request to the specified API endpoint (`source`).
      It handles the response using promises:
      The response is converted to JSON format using the `.json()` method.
      The resulting JSON data, specifically the `users.data` property, is used to update the state by calling `this.setState()` (assuming this code is within a React component). It sets the `users_data` property of the state to the fetched user data and sets the `loading` property to `false`.
      If any errors occur during the process, they are caught and logged to the console using `console.error()`.
      
   3. The `<Users>` component is rendered with the `loading` and `users` props passed to it. 
 
B) User.js

1. The component's render function returns different JSX elements based on the `loading` state:
    If `loading` is true, it renders an empty `<div>` element with the id "main".
    If `loading` is false, it renders a `<div>` element with the className "row" and the id "main". Inside this div, it uses `.map()` to iterate over the `users` array and render user information within individual `<div>` elements with appropriate classes.
    Each user's information includes an image, ID, name, and email. The user's avatar is displayed using an `<img>` element, assuming the `user.avatar` property contains the image URL. The ID, name, and email are rendered within `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>` elements,Â respectively.
